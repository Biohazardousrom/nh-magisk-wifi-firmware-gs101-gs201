## Wireless Firmware for Nethunter

This Magisk module adds the required firmware for external wireless adapters to be used with Nethunter.

**NOTE:** Your kernel still needs to support external network adapters. This module only provides missing firmware, if any.

The list of included firmware is given below. For other devices, [create a new issue on GitHub  here.](https://github.com/rithvikvibhu/nh-magisk-wifi-firmware/issues)

This module should work with any variant of Nethunter, but it was created to work with __Nali Kethunter__ (https://forum.xda-developers.com/android/software-hacking/nali-kethunter-modded-kernel-supported-t3770455) - another Magisk module by [@LazerL0rd](https://forum.xda-developers.com/member.php?u=7836278) which systemlessly installs Kali Nethunter.
